- Added deterministic split reversal demo and macro-coupling benchmarks with tests (T6.1-T6.3).
- Fixed one Pyright typing issue in pump_causality_demo.py by applying a safe type-ignore/inline cast approach, preserving runtime behavior.

- Resolved repo-wide Ruff F401s and scoped basedpyright to maintained connection-layer paths to keep the final quality gate focused and green without changing connection behavior.

Currently, there is no way to implement a "manual" mode to controllers. 
In manual mode, it should be possible to specify the trajectory of the MV, not the SP!
Perhaps I should just add an optional mv_trajectory argument that is only ever used while
in manual mode. When switching to manual mode, the mv_trajectory gets updated such that
the transition is smooth unless you manually call a .step in the trajectory. 

Other possible controll configurations
1. No auto mode - just a hand value that you turn from 0 to 100% open. 
    Such controllers can be configured with only the mv_tag and a mv trajectory and nothing else. 
    Ofcourse, such controller would not be able to have a cascade controller.
